```lrc
[00:18.52] Home alone, trying not to eat
[00:22.47] Distract myself with pornography
[00:26.89] I hate the way she looks at me
[00:33.80] I can't stand the dialogue, she would never be
[00:39.62] That satisfied, it's a male fantasy
[00:44.02] I'm going back to therapy
[00:56.52] 
[00:51.22] 'Cause I loved you then, and I love you now
[00:55.70] And I don't know how
[00:59.89] Guess it's hard to know when nobody else comes around
[01:08.76] If I'm getting over you
[01:13.47] Or just pretending to
[01:18.04] Be alright, convince myself I hate you
[01:37.04] 
[01:33.01] (Want me to put it here?)
[01:34.87] (Okay)
[01:37.87] 
[01:38.31] I got a call from a girl I used to know
[01:42.82] We were inseparable years ago
[01:46.54] Thought we'd get along, but it wasn't so
[01:53.84] And it's all I think about when I'm behind the wheel
[02:00.01] I worry this is how I'm always gonna feel
[02:04.25] But nothing lasts, I know the deal
[02:21.25] 
[02:11.28] But I loved you then, and I love you now
[02:15.63] And I don't know how
[02:19.86] Guess it's hard to know when nobody else comes around
[02:28.96] If I'm getting over you
[02:33.29] Or just pretending to
[02:37.93] Be alright, convince myself I hate you
[02:56.93] 
[02:48.56] Can't get over you
[02:52.77] No matter what I do
[02:57.05] I know I should, but I could never hate you
